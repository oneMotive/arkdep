Arkdep is the set of tools providing immutability to Arkane Linux. It attempts to differentiate itself from other similar tools by being "stupidly simple", hackable, flexible and easy to adopt for personal projects.

> [!NOTE]
> Arkdep is still in active development, breaking changes might still happen as the project moves toward stable. The current codebase has yet to be thoroughly tested, there may be lingering bugs or other issues.

## Documentation and usage
For documentation refer to the [Arkane Linux Arkdep Documentation](https://docs.arkanelinux.org/arkdep/arkdep-usage/).

Note: This is my personal arkanelinux build....
